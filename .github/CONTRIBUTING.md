# How to Contribute


👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to read this and contribute! 🎉👍

Third-party contributions help us grow and improve QMK. We want to make the pull request and contribution process useful and easy for both contributors and maintainers.

## Bugs/Enhancements

Found something that is broken or could be improved?

The best place to get quick support is going to be on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uq7gcHh). There is usually somebody online, and there are a bunch of very helpful people there.

Otherwise raise an issue against the project with any details you can provide.
